# LiquidFunProcessing
**Box2D/LiquidFun Library for Processing.**

Particle based fluid simulation and rigid body simulation using [jBox2D/LiquidFun](https://github.com/jbox2d/jbox2d)

## Examples
The library includes a lot of examples from the original ![jbox2d testbed](https://github.com/jbox2d/jbox2d/tree/master/jbox2d-testbed/src/main/java/org/jbox2d/testbed/tests).
For a quick start, each sketch has a couple of default eventhandlers:

- LMB: drag rigid bodies / particles
- LMB + SHIFT: shoot a bullet
- MMB: spawn particles
- RMB: destroy particles

as well as some key-mapping, e.g. to display the debug-draw, restart, pause/resume.
of course, each of those can be altered, overwritten or disable/removed.
